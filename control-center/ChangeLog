	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Forgot a trailing backslash so
	GNOMECC_CFLAGS wasn't actually being used.  It is now.

2001-01-24  Bradford Hovinen  <hovinen@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Cleaned out kruft and replaced it with
	GNOMECC_CFLAGS
	(gnomecc_LDADD): Ditto

2000-12-27  Jacob "Ulysses" Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* capplet-dir-view-list.c (list_populate): call the real
	gnome-libs API rather than my hacked one

	* capplet-dir.c (start_capplet_through_root_manager): pass the
	correct path ($prefix/sbin/<tool>) to the root-manager
	(capplet_activate): check that the Exec line begins with
	root-manager rather than root-manager-helper (for now)

2000-12-26  Jacob "Ulysses" Berkman  <jacob@helixcode.com>

	* capplet-dir-view*.c: new html view, and split other views into
	seperate parts

	* capplet-dir.c (start_capplet_through_root_manager): Use
	FOPEN_MAX rather than OPEN_MAX, since some people don't seem to be
	have OPEN_MAX defined by default

2000-08-22  Bradford Hovinen  <hovinen@helixcode.com>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Changed SETTINGS_DIR to
	$(datadir)/control-center

2000-08-17  Stanislav Brabec  <utx@penguin.cz>

	* Makefile.am: Added GNOME_LIBDIR to root_manager_LDADD.

	* all: First checkin of (nearly) complete rewrite. Changes too
	numerous to mention.
