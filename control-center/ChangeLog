	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Forgot a trailing backslash so

	correct path ($prefix/sbin/<tool>) to the root-manager
	(capplet_activate): check that the Exec line begins with
	root-manager rather than root-manager-helper (for now)

	* capplet-dir.c (start_capplet_through_root_manager): Use

	* all: First checkin of (nearly) complete rewrite. Changes too
	numerous to mention.
