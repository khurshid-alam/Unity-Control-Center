We have just begun the GNOME 2 port of the control center on the HEAD
branch of CVS. At this point, it is not guaranteed to compile or
run. If you wish to have a working control center, use the branch
gnome-1-4-branch by issuing the following command:

cvs -z3 up -r gnome-1-4-branch

Please do not file bug reports pertaining to the current state of the
HEAD branch.
