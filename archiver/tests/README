This is a test suite for the archiver. It is designed to ease the pain
of formulating the (rather complex) tests the check all the
functionality of the archiver. Simply loading up the GUI and playing
around with it is not enough, since one wrong move can destroy a
person's configuration.

Tests: The test suite checks the following functionality:

	1. On an account or machine where data have never been
	   archived, the default location and archive are properly 
	   and automatically set up without user intervention.

	2. Locations inheriting the default location are created
	   and destroyed properly.

	3. Backends can be added and removed from non-toplevel
	   locations, with both full and partial containment. Any
	   attempt to do so on a toplevel location results in an
	   error.

	4. Rollback data may be stored on both the base and derived
	   locations. When stored in the derived location where the
	   backend is marked with partial containment, the rollback
	   data represent only the differences between the derived and
	   parent configurations. The most recent configuration from
	   the parent location is used for making this determination.

	5. When rolling a backend back in a derived location, if the
	   backend is not marked as contained in the derived location,
	   the data are retrieved from the location's parent
	   recursively. If the backend is marked as partially
	   contained, then the XML data are merged with the parent's
	   data.

	6. Changing the current location correctly invokes the
	   rollback algorithm

	7. Rolling back by date and by number of steps works in a
	   manner similar to the above.

	8. Logs accurately represent the data archived.

	9. Backends are invoked properly and data are sent to them
	   properly.

	10. All erroneous input should result in an error and not a
	    crash. The program should return an appropriate error
	    condition.
