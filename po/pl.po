"This is actually just a shell script that grabs a frame of video from the "

"manipulate and recombine the video frame in various ways (edge detection, "
"subtracting the image from a rotated version of itself, etc.) Then it "
"displays that image for a few seconds, and does it again. This works really "
"well if you just feed broadcast television into it. Currently, the three "
"lines of the script that actually grab the source picture are SGI specific, "
