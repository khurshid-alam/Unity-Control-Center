"Like qix, this uses a simple motion model to generate many different display "
"modes. The control points attract each other up to a certain distance, and "
"then begin to repel each other. The attraction/repulsion is proportional to "
"the distance between any two particles, similar to the strong and weak "
"nuclear forces. One of the most interesting ways to watch this hack is "
"simply as bouncing balls, because their motions and interactions with each "
"other are so odd. Sometimes two balls will get into a tight orbit around "
"each other, to be interrupted later by a third, or by the edge of the "
"screen. It looks quite chaotic. Written by Jamie Zawinski, based on Lisp "
"code by John Pezaris."
