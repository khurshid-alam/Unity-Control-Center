# There are a lot of comparative word forms used in the screensaver xml
# files in the ends of a slider. Please translate these to Finnish as
# positive forms, so "More delay" becomes "Suuri viive" and so on.
#
# I have translated repository harshly to version, the meaning of which
# is a bit different, but if I am correct, there are no such things
# as versions in the archiver program so it does not matter.
