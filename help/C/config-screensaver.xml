  <title>Screensaver</title>
  <para>
    Screensavers are nearly old as computers.  Initially, they were
    meant keep images from being 'burned' onto the monitor screen.
    This would ruin the monitor.  Today, technology has advanced
    enough that images no longer get burnt on your monitor.  However,
    people enjoy using screensavers because they look cool and
    entertain visitors.
