[ Things prefaced with GSD need to be fixed in the gnome-settings daemon
  and not the dialog ]

MOUSE PROPERTIES:

 * Add cursors to CVS (I have them locally) and install them
 * GSD: actually do the 'xset' to load the cursors at start time
 * GSD: Add support for devices other than CoreInput.

KEYBOARD PROPERTIES:

 * GSD: support keyboard bell
 * Remove awful jrb-art and replace with actual blinking cursor.

DEFAULT APPLICATIONS PROPERTIES:

 * Move to libglade support
 * Merge in Window Manager properties
 * Test that GConf changes affect the dialog

ALL DIALOGS:

 * Change buttons to use whatever the UI team comes up with
 * Make sure GSD exists using bonobo-activation

GNOME SETTINGS DAEMON:

 * GSD: Confirm all XSettings settings are correct, and have support in GTK+
 * GSD: Register with session management so we are started before
   anything else is started
 * GSD: add bonobo-activation support so that we can guarantee it's running.
 * GSD: Hook up locate_pointer to the GConf key rather than do it every time.
