    <_description>This displays 2D projections of the sequence of 3D objects which are the projections of the 4D analog to the cube: as a square is composed of four lines, each touching two others; and a cube is composed of six squares, each touching four others; a hypercube is composed of eight cubes, each touching six others.  To make it easier to visualize the rotation, it uses a different color for the edges of each face.  Don't think about it too long, or your brain will melt.  Written by Joe Keane, Fritz Mueller, and Jamie Zawinski.</_description>
