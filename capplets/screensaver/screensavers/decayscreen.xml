    <_description>This takes an image and makes it melt.  You've no doubt seen this effect before, but no screensaver would really be complete without it.  It works best if there's something colorful visible.  Warning, if the effect continues after the screen saver is off, seek medical attention.  Written by David Wald and Vivek Khera.</_description>
