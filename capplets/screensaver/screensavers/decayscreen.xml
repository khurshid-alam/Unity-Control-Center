    <_description>This grabs an image of whatever is on your screen, and makes it melt.  You've no doubt seen this effect before, but no screensaver would really be complete without it.  It works best if there's something colorful visible.  Warning, if the effect continues after the screen saver is off, seek medical attention.  Written by David Wald and Vivek Khera.  

A number of these screenhacks have the ability to take an image of your desktop and manipulate it in some way.  On SGI systems, these programs are able to (at random) pull their source image from the system's video input instead!  This works nicely if you leave some some random television station plugged in.</_description>
