    <_description>This one draws spinning, animating (are you detecting a pattern here yet?)  explorations of the Julia set.  You've probably seen static images of this fractal form before, but it's a lot of fun to watch in motion as well.  One interesting thing is that there is a small swinging dot passing in front of the image, which indicates the control point from which the rest of the image was generated.
