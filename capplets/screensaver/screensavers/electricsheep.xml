    <_description>ElectricSheep is an xscreensaver module that displays mpeg video of an animated fractal flame.  In the background, it contributes render cycles to the next animation.  Periodically it uploades completed frames to the server, where they are compressed for distribution to all clients.  

This program is recommended only if you have a high bandwidth connection to the Internet.
