    <_description>This program draws a simulation of a sonar screen.  Written by default, it displays a random assortment of ``bogies'' on the screen, but if compiled properly, it can ping (pun intended) your local network, and actually plot the proximity of the other hosts on your network to you.  It would be easy to make it monitor other sources of data, too.  (Processes?	 Active network connections?  CPU usage per user?)	Written by Stephen Martin.</_description>
