    <_description>This grabs a screen image, carves it up into a jigsaw puzzle, shuffles it, and then solves the puzzle.  This works especially well when you feed it an external video signal instead of letting it grab the screen image (actually, I guess this is generally true...)	When it is grabbing a video image, it is sometimes pretty hard to guess what the image is going to look like once the puzzle is solved.  Written by Jamie Zawinski.</_description>
