    <_description>This grabs an image of whatever is on your screen, divides it into a grid, and then randomly shuffles the squares around as if it was one of those annoying ``16-puzzle'' games, where there is a grid of squares, one of which is missing.  I hate trying to solve those puzzles, but watching one permute itself is more amusing.  Written by Jamie Zawinski.</_description>
