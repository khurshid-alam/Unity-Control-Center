    <_description>XMountains generates realistic-looking fractal terrains of snow-capped mountains near water, with either a top view or a side view.  Written by Stephen Booth.  This is not included with the XScreenSaver package, but if you don't have it already, you can find it at &lt;http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/~spb/xmountains/&gt;.  

Be sure to compile it with -DVROOT or it won't work right when launched by the xscreensaver daemon.</_description>
