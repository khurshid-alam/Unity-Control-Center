    <_description>This program makes collages out of random images pulled off of the World Wide Web.  It finds these images by doing random web searches, and then extracting images from the returned pages.  It can also be set up to filter the images through the `VidWhacker' program, above, which looks really great.  

(Note that most of the images it finds are text, and not pictures.  This is because most of the web is pictures of text.  Which is pretty sad.)  Written by Jamie Zawinski.</_description>
