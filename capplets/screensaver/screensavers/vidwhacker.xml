    <_description>This is actually just a shell script that grabs a frame of video from the system's video input, and then uses some PBM filters (chosen at random) to manipulate and recombine the video frame in various ways (edge detection, subtracting the image from a rotated version of itself, etc.)  Then it displays that image for a few seconds, and does it again.  This works really well if you just feed broadcast television into it.  

Currently, the three lines of the script that actually grab the source picture are SGI specific, but it should be trivial to adapt it to work on other systems that can grab video (please send me the changes if you do this...)</_description>
