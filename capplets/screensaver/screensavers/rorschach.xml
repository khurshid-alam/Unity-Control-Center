    <_description>This generates random inkblot patterns.  The algorithm is deceptively simple for how well it works; it merely walks a dot around the screen randomly, and then reflects the image horizontally, vertically, or both.  Any deep-seated neurotic tendencies which this program reveals are your own problem.  Written by Jamie Zawinski.</_description>
