	* gnome-keybinding-properties.c (setup_dialog): man, was this code
	silly.  Also, themes are case sensitive.
	(is_metacity_running): Add support for metacity keybindings.  This
	is off by default until I write code to actually detect metacity.

	* gnome-keybinding-properties.c (create_dialog) : remove the startup
	  warning caused by looking in the current directory for the glade file.
	(key_theme_changed) : add some protection for missing schemas.

	* gnome-keybinding-properties.c (setup_dialog): Only show themes
	if they actually have a keybinding.  Also, initialize the keytheme
	correctly.

	* keybinding.desktop.in:

	Use "keyboard shortcuts" to match the window title
